The [SOSAA model](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/multi-scale-modelling/sosaa) is a chemistry transport model that has been actively developed in the Multi-Scale Modelling Group at the University of Helsinki since 2011 [^1] [^2]. SOSAA has been continuously improved and applied in various studies, including [^3] [^4] [^5].

Unfortunately, the SOSAA model is not yet publicly available. However, access to the complete SOSAA source code is provided upon request -- please contact Michael Boy (michael.boy@helsinki.fi), Putian Zhou (putian.zhou@helsinki.fi), or Petri Clusius (petri.clusius@helsinki.fi) for more information.

This repository is a public pin of [SOSAA@10618aa](https://version.helsinki.fi/putian.zhou/sosaa/-/tree/10618aa98c7470546308adf132afb0bc0735b4eb), the now-outdated version of SOSAA that was used in [Juniper Tyree](https://github.com/juntyr)'s Masters Thesis ["Prudent Response Surface Models"](https://github.com/juntyr/prudent-response-surface-models) for the M.Sc. Theoretical and Computational Methods programme at the University of Helsinki. Note that this repository only provides a record to ensure that all parts of thesis are published under open access. This version has since been superseded by later versions and that there is no promise of functionality. Please contact Petri Clusius (petri.clusius@helsinki.fi) if you want to use SOSAA (especially a newer version) in your own research.
